### Homework Assignment

Three part homework assignment:
* **Level One** is an `AssociateProfitSplitter` contract. This will accept ether into the contract, and divide it evenly among associate-level employees. This will allow the human resources department to pay employees quickly and efficiently.

* **Level Two** is a `TieredProfitSplitter` that will distribute different percentages of incoming ether to employees at different tiers/levels. For example, the CEO gets paid 60%, CTO 25%, and Bob gets 15%.

* **Level Three** is a `DeferredEquityPlan` that models traditional company stock plans. This contract will automatically manage 1000 shares, with an annual distribution of 250 shares over four years for a single employee.
